					5A Classes Cont.


We should program our code in a way such that it is loosely coupled
	This allows for extensability, without the need for recompilation or extensive changes to the code
		Our code should be cohesive: the property of a class to be focused (not necessarily generalized), the class should have a specific purpose
			Alterations to a classes should not change how it works intrinsically




When looking at the size of an object in memory, look at the data members of the class to determine the size.

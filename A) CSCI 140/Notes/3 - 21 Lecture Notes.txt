		Lecture 3A - Functions and an Introduction to Recursion

Functions have a single responsibility

SOLID - (not on exam, remember single-responsibility principle)
Single-Responsibility Principle
Open-Close Principle
Liskov Substitution Princple 
Interface Segregation Principle
Dependency Inversion Principle

	Function Prototypes
Prototypes do not require function names, a function prototype is made for the compiler to tell it that there will be a function with its given name in the program.

The signature of a function is the identifier, the number of parameters, and the order of the types of parameters.

	Translation Unit

A translation unit is a single unit of code that the computer can compile into an object file
	- has a scope of its own

	Random Number Generation

When using a RNG, ensure to not seed it in a loop, only seed the RNG once at the beginning prior to the call of the RNG.

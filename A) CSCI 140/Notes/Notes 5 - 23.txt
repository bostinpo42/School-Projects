				Topic 7 File Processing

C++ I/O (input/output) occurs in streams, which themselves are sequences of bytes

For input operations, bytes flow from a device (keyboard, disc drive, network, etc) to the system's memory (RAM)

C++ provides "low-level" and "high-level" I/O capabilities
	low-level i/o (unformatted i/o) specify some number of bytes to be transferred device-to-memory or memory-to-device
		the individual byte is the item of interest
		high-speed, high-volume transfers but somewhat inconvenient
	
	high-level i/o (formatted i/o) bytes are grouped into meaningful units, i.e integers, floating point numbers, characters, strings or user-defined types
		type-oriented capabilities are satisfactory for most i/o other than high-volume file processing


#include <cstdio>

fopen("filename", "rb")  // opens file with read binary
fopen("filename", "wb")  // opens file with write binary

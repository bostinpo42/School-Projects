				5/16 EXAM # 3

1) Problem with Inheritence, stream insertion operator overriding, assignment operator overriding

2) Friend functions are not influenced by access modifiers (private and public). Insertion operator overriding should be a friend function

3) Given class declaration and implementation, try to find errors, specifically where the problem is and what it is

4) Fill in the blank 

5) Public and Private access modifiers, how they affect functions and inheritence (Protected as well)

6) New operator, review stack. Dynamically allocated memory and deleting new elements and arrays of elements delete[]

7) Static members and static methods, review notes for examples (counter variable in a class)
	static means data member of class is available to all classes, cannot be accessed by instanced members
		know what an instance is of a class, what it means similar to object of a class
			instanciating class

8) know terminology used for inheritence, base and derived, parent and child, etc.

9) look up polymorphism, understand and know polymorphism (variable of base type can be assigned an object of a derived type)
	read lecture notes 6A, 6B for tables

10) Virtual functions and pure virtual functions (overriden in derived class, derived class will execute function, otherwise the base class will execute it)

11) How we created the pure virtual function, how it made the class an abstract class. The function must be made from a derived class

12) struct and class, the differences between the two
	structs by default will have public members
	classes by default will have private members

13) smart pointers, remember what header file was required for smart pointers
	<memory>
		creation of a smart pointer, pointer to an object. makeunique for unique pointer

14) Given some programs, know the output and what the program does

15) what the sizeof operator means, and how to use it
	int v;			sizeof(int)
	sizeof v;

	int* v;
	sizeof v; // this will only get the size of a pointer, ALL pointers have the same size

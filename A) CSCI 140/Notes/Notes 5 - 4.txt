					Topic 5 Classes, Lecture 5c Operator Overloading

Classes & Structs are almost exactly the same, with one exception which is: 
	Structs come from C programming, which does not contain classes. Structs are NOT objects and therefore do not have member functions in C programming
		The one difference between classes and structs in C++ : 
			By default, if no access modifiers are declared in a class everything within the class will be private.
			By default, if no access modifiers are declared in a struct everything within the struct will be public.


Data Conversion Types:
	Implicit - data types will usually be converted
	Explicit - data types MUST be explicitly defined
	None - no data conversion

Design Notes

Dungeon
    -12 pits distributed randomly
        *any random funtion generator can be used
    -1 Aldrac
    -They should not be located at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1)
    -The grid should be 8x8, with 64 cells
    -Enter/exit at (0,0)
    -1 box of gold (end goal) located at a random location
    -artifact locations are unknown
    -artifacts cannot share a cell, they must each have their own individual cells
    -perceptions are displayed as 
        * G, gold
        * S, stench
        * B, breeze
        * U, user location

Perception
    -all perceptions are only in orthagonal cells
    -when in an orthagonal cell to a pit, we sense a breeze (B)
    -when in an orthagonal cell to the Aldrac, we sense a stench (S)
    -when in the cell with the gold, we sense a faint glimmer (G)
    -perceptions are only displayed when the player enters a cell and will continue to be displayed for the rest of the duration of the game

Movement
    -player can only move in 4 directions: right, left, up, and down (R, L, U, D)
    -player can pick up gold with P
        *cannot pick up gold in an empty room
        *display message when carrying gold
    -cannot move out of bounds (issue error: invalid movement)

Gameplay
    -clear the screen between moves
    -if the user enters a room with a pit or Aldrac, the game ends with a loss
    -prompt to play again after the game ends
    -player wins if they reach the enter/exit (0,0) while carrying the gold

Code
    -clear instream after input
    -input should be case insensitive
    
Design
    -class implementation
        * UI
        * Dungeon
        * Controller class

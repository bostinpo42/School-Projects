Looping Structure

for ([declaration and/or initialization]; [test condition]; [update])
[] brackets mean this part of the loop structure is optional

for and while loops will execute 0 or more times.
do-while loops will execute at least 1 or more times.

Arrays are always more efficient than vectors, because vectors are dynamically allocated and can change in size. This means that it uses dynamically allocated memory,
therefore it will always be more expensive than an array.

Because arrays are static in size, they are much more memory efficient than a vector, as it does not require an iterator.

Topic 11 Sets and Selection

Sets typically use iterators so that we can iterate through the collection. 
    Iterators always have 2 functions: begin() and end().
    begin() returns a pointer to the beginning of the collection, ex. the first element of an array.
    end() returns a a pointer to the element beyond the array, so nullptr, but after the collection.

We usually override relational operators for our iterator, so that we can compare elements of the collection to eachother.

Selection

Prune and search essentially uses partitionining similar to quicksort in order to find specific element in our collection.
    We can create 3 different sets to do so:
    lower - set of values lower in rank than the kth smallest value
    equal - set of values equal in rank to the kth smallest value
    greater - set of values greater in rank than the kth smallest value

Trie
    stands for retrieval
    either implemented with arrays, n-ary tree
    dimension of the tree is based on the size of the alphabet
    in n-ary tree, n = size of alphabet.
    a-z, 26 characters
    for c in alphabet, c - 'a' will give us subscript 0. 'b' will give subscript 1, 'c' will give 2, and so on.

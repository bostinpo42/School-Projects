Topic 9 Cont. Dynamic Programming

Strings cont.

    In ASCII there are 128 symbols, as only 7 bits are used as symbols, because ASCII uses signed integer values.

    Set of DNA {A, C, T, G}

    Substring vs Subsequence
        Substring - ordering of elements is necessary (to form words, etc.)
        Subsequence - ordering of elements is not necessary

    String S = {A, C, T, A, G, A, T}
    String T = {A, T, G, A, C, G, T}

    Finding the longest Subsequence
        We are trying to find the longest subsequence (in which left to right order is necessary, but does not need to be contiguous). 
        Subsequence - {A, T, A, G, T}

    Let S1 = s.substring(size(s) - 1)  //reduce size of S by 1.

    LCS(string S, string T) {
        if(|sizeof(S)| or |sizeof(T)| = 0) return 0

        if(s.back() = t.back()) return 1 + lcs(S1, T1);

        return max(LCS(S1, T) or LCS(S, T1)) // we return the max between the two recursive calls

        return number of symbols in longest subsequence    
    }

String Compression
    Set of Letters - {A, B, C, D, E}
    String S - {A B C B C A D E E A B B C D E}
    |S| = 15
    |set| = 5


    Hoffman Coding Algorithm - lossless compression algorithm
    We order the set in ascending order
    B = 2
    D = 2
    C = 3
    A = 4
    E = 5
    We take the two lowest cost pairs and join them to a common ancestor. 
    We combine B and D, making them 4.
    We combine 4 and 3, making them 7.
    We combine 4 and 5, making them 9.
    We combine 7 and 9, making them 16.
    The path to the left child is 0, the path to the right child is 1.
    The path that it takes to reach a specific character will be the bits required to map that character.
    Ex. to get to B, we would need to traverse 000. B is now mapped to 000.    
    Encode tree for hca.


    Fixed-Sized Compression
    bits = |S| * log2(|set|) + 55 bits
    bits = 15 * 3 + 55 = 100 bits

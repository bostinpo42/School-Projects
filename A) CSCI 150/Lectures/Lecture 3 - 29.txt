To get an integer value input from the user, because the value is stored as a string in memory ex. 55 = '5' '5' ; to get the actual integer value we have to
get the offset from an ASCII table. so to get 5 we would have to find the ASCII value for '5' and subtract 48 (where the digits begin in ASCII). so 53 - 48 = '5'

String prompt goes into data
Input goes into BSS


(53-48) + 10(53-48) = 55

when the user input a number ex '8' it will appear as '8', 0xA (newline) because they input enter.

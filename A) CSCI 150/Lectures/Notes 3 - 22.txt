	Topic 4 Lecture 4a - Data Transfer

Operand Types

Immediate - constant integer - value is encoded within instruction

Register - name of a register - register name is converted to a number and encoded within the instruction

Memory - reference to a location in memory - memory address is encoded within instruction or a register holds the address of a memory location

db - data byte / defined byte

dereferencing [] will pull the value stored in a specific memory address.

mov instruction : 
	- move from source to destination : mov destination, source
	- no more than one memor operand is permitted
	- CS, EIP, and IP cannot be the destination
	- no immediate to segment moves

You must explicitly code for the size of the memory location.

When you copy a smaller value into a larger destination, MOVZX instruction fills (extends) the upper half of the destination with zeros

The MOVSX instruction fills the upper half of the destination with a copy of the source operands sign bit.

The location of an array represents only the first byte, which is why offsets are used when dealing with arrays to access the other values in the array.
